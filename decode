# Script for the K9AN WSPR decoder, by DJ0ABR
# ===========================================
# use the k9an decoder to get the spots out of the wav sound file
# the file 'spots' is used for storing all the spots and debug information
# the file wsprd.out contains the current spots in the format for wsprnet.org
# wsprdsum.out is used as a temporary storage if the upload fails
